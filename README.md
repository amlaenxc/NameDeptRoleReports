I had been hearing from many librarians that they wanted to be able to see, given
a list of names, department and or role information, for example to know the department
affiliations of people who swiped in to attend an event at the library. The usual
university system doesn't give this data, only names. So, I wrote this script
to grab that data from the Outlook directory.
NB: This only works in classic Outlook as Microsoft hasn't added developer tools
to new Outlook yet.
